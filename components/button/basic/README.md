### ButtonBasic

This button is following Schibsted Spain UX Guide Style.

It offers different types, that will change colors. Those flavours are: 'primary', 'secondary', 'accent', 'ghost', 'flat'.

Also, you can use it in three different sizes: 'small', 'medium', 'large'.

Moreover, it has a layout property. Right now, it only accepts the 'full' layout, in order to get all the width available of the container.

Obviously you can use both type and size in order to get your desired button. For example:

```javascript
<ButtonBasic
  size='small'
  type='flat'
/>
```

Check the playground and the available propTypes of the component in order to get a complete view of the possibilities of the component.
